# Correlation and Relationships

# Is there a correlation between BMI and charges?
# How does the number of children affect insurance charges?
# Is there a significant difference in charges between smokers and non-smokers?
# Do charges vary significantly by sex?



# Regional Analysis

# Which region has the highest average charges?
# How does the number of children affect charges in each region?



# Advanced Analysis

# Can we predict charges based on age, BMI, number of children, smoking status, and region?
# What are the main factors affecting charges in the model?



# Trend Analysis
# Are there any trends in charges based on age or BMI?
# Does the region have any significant trends in charges over time (if time data is available)?



# Outlier Detection

# Are there any outliers in charges, BMI, or age?
# How do outliers impact the overall analysis of charges?



# Statistical Analysis

# What is the distribution of charges?
# What statistical tests can we perform to determine if the differences in charges between groups (e.g., smokers vs. non-smokers) are significant?



# Visualization

# How can we visualize the relationship between age and charges?
# What patterns can be identified through scatter plots or box plots of charges against different variables?



# Customer Segmentation

# Can we segment customers into groups based on their charges and demographic information?
# What are the characteristics of high-charge vs. low-charge customers?
